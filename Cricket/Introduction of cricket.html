        <p>
            Cricket is a bat-and ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the center of which 
            is a 22-yard(20-meter;66-foot) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails(small sticks)balanced
            on three stumps.Two players from the batting team,the striker and non-stricker,stand in front of either wicket
            holding bats,while one player from the fielding team,the bolwer,bowls the ball toward the stricker's wicket from 
            the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then batting team 
            scoring one run for each of exchanges.Runs are also scored when the abll reaches the boundary of field or when 
            the ball is bowled illegally.<br><br>
