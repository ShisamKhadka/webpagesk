        <h1><center>Cricket Crease</center></h1>
        <p>A<b>Cricket Crease</b> is a certain area demarcated by white lines painted or chalked on the field of play,
        and pursuant to the rules of cricket they help determine legal play in differnt ways for fielding and batting 
        side.They define the area within which the batsman and bowlers operate.The term Crease may refer to any if lines
        themselves,particularly the pooping crease, or the region that they demsrk.Law7 of the Law of Cricket governs
        the size and position of the crease markings, and defines the actual line as the b;ack edge of the width of the 
        marked line on the soil,i.e, the edge naerest to the wicket at the end.<br>
        For the fielding side , the crease defines whether there is a no-ball because the wicket-keeper has moved in 
        front of the wicket before he permitted to do so.In addition,historically part of the bowler's back foot in the
         delivery stride was required to fall behind the bowling crease to avoid a delivery being no-ball.Thia rule was
        replaced by a requirement that the bowler'sfront foot in delivery stride must land with some part of it behind 
        the pooping crease<br>
